# R1-02 Breadcrumbs and back action for nested diagrams

Labels: ux, navigation, phase-1
Phase: 1
Depends on: R1-01
References: docs/ai-ux-2026.md, docs/nested-diagrams.md

## Problem
Users cannot see where they are in nested hierarchies or return without losing state.

## Acceptance Criteria
System.Object[]

## Notes
- Breadcrumb clicks should be idempotent when re-opening the same level.
