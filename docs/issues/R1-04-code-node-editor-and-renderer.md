# R1-04 Code node editor and renderer

Labels: ux, code, phase-1
Phase: 1
Depends on: R0-02
References: docs/ai-ux-2026.md

## Problem
Code nodes are not yet first-class, limiting rich documentation graphs.

## Acceptance Criteria
System.Object[]

## Notes
- Start with static highlighting; AI detection can be layered later.
